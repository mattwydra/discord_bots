# Discord Bot README

Welcome!

## Plans: 
1. Create a new bot using DiscordGO
2. Move other Discord bots (python and js) to this repo
3. Learn about branching and merging
4. Create and add additional bots using python, js, or go to do the following:
   - Add/delete reminders to a google calendar (as well as remind the user)
   - Create a 'pantry bot' that adds recipes/ingredients to the pantry. Further, it will be able to support functionality to give the user a list of recipes they can use with their current list of ingredients
   - Todo list bot, which is similar to reminders, but mostly for a list of items that doesn't need to be ordered or could be ordered
   - Functionality for my web-based [minigames](https://mattwydra.github.io/projects/) inside of discord (ability to run these minigames in the discord app instead of having to go to my website)
   - And much, much more!
