The hero is you
The only way to get better is to face your fears and suffer
When you think you are done, you're only 40% in
Pain unlocks a secret doorway in the mind, one that leads to both peak performance and beautiful silence
The most important conversations you'll ever have are the ones you'll have with yourself
You are in danger of living a life so comfortable and soft that you will die without ever realizing your true potential

Pain unlocks a secret doorway in the mind, one that leads to both peak performance and beautiful silence
Don't stop when you're tired. Stop when you're done
